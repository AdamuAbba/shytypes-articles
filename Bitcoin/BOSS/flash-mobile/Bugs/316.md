**Describe the bug**  
The build process fails with the error when attempting to run the app locally:  
`Build input file cannot be found: '/Users/abba/Documents/flash-mobile/ios/GoogleService-Info.plist'. Did you forget to declare this file as an output of a script phase or custom build rule which produces it?`

**To Reproduce**  
Steps to reproduce the behavior:  
1. Clone into the project
2. `cd` into the directory
3. type `yarn install`
4. Open the project in Xcode using `arch -x86_64 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/MacOS/Xcode` on an M1 MacBook.  
5. Attempt to build the iOS project.  
6. Observe the error in the build log.  

**Expected behavior**  
The project should build successfully without requiring the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file when Firebase integration is not intended or the missing `GoogleService-info.plist` should be provided.
