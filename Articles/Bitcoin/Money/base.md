- **Functions of Money**:

  - Secondary: Other contingent functions.

  - Currency: Tangible (notes, coins), with geographical/physical limitations.
- **Evolution of Money**:
  - Key events: Gold Standard (1816), US Federal Reserve (1913), Great Depression (1930), suspension of gold standard (1971), Global Financial Crisis (2008/9), Bitcoin (2009).
