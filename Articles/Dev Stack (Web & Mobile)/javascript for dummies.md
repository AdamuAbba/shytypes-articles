# An epic not so clich√© introduction

If you had to google **_"kindred"_** then you've come to the right place. I did too, before adding it to the title because _"big words"_ only lead to a partial understanding of a subject matter without some additional due diligence and research trust me, everyone wants to sound smart right ?....well not me. if at the end of this article, you do not have some understanding to a certain degree of what javascript entails and why it's one of the best things that ever happened to the internet, then just know this, I add both salt and sugar to my toast for some weird subjective reason because I love the taste and this information has completely zero correlation to the subject at hand.

well now that that's out of the way, moving on. An ideal webpage would comprise mainly of three of the following

| Acronym    | Logo                                                                                                            | Expansion                 | What the heck does it even do ?                                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML       | <img alt="HTML" src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/html-1.svg" height="30" width="30" />                | Hypertext Markup Language | Kinda like your skeleton,dry and lifeless like my bank account. it gives structure to a webpage |
| CSS        | <img alt="CSS" src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/css-3.svg" height="30" width="30" />                  | Cascading Style Sheets    | puts some flesh on that skeleton, makes it look less dead, like my social life ü§£..üòê           |
| Javascript | <img alt="Javascript" src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/logo-javascript.svg" height="30" width="30" /> | Javascript (literally)    | the good stuff üëá ....keep reading or leave now, like my ex                                     |

that wasn't so hard right? even i now this. But then you're here to learn a bit about javascript before you get bored, confused or uninterested and hop on away to some other article online seeing as most z-gens including i myself have the attention span of a brazilian rooster in heat.

## 1. <u>What is javascript?</u>

### _"The fancy definition"_

According to [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-javascript-definition-of-js/#:~:text=JavaScript%20is%20a%20dynamic%20programming%20language%20that%27s%20used%20for%20web%20development%2C%20in%20web%20applications%2C%20for%20game%20development%2C%20and%20lots%20more.%20It%20allows%20you%20to%20implement%20dynamic%20features%20on%20web%20pages%20that%20cannot%20be%20done%20with%20only%20HTML%20and%20CSS.)

> _"JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more. It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS"_.

### _"The not so fancy and probably confusing definition"_

javascript is programming language that makes websites feel **alive** and less boring or static. sure, you can do a lot with html and css but but then why bother talking to your crush on a date after getting him/her to agree to go out with you?. you would look pale without blood right and you would start to feel sick with limited _"functionalities"_ well i'm beginning to confuse myself with all the not so good examples but my point is, a website could look beautiful but would have little to no functional relevance without javascript it would be a beautiful mess get it ?.

## 2. javascript as a "class-based OOL"

javascript as a language is an **_Object-Oriented Programming Language_** which is one out of the "5" types of programming languages namely;

- Procedural Programming Language
- Functional Programming Language
- Scripting Programming Language
- Logic Programming Language
- Object-Oriented Programming Language

now before you ask me what the heck that is, how about we go through some definitions shall we?,

### **_"The fancy definition, yet again"_**

caution‚ùóÔ∏è, so after googling _"what is an ool"_ this was the first search result and i gotta say, it was a really boring and a lot to take in.

> _"Object-oriented language (OOL) is a high-level computer programming language that implements objects and their associated procedures within the programming context to create software programs. Object-oriented language uses an object-oriented programming technique that binds related data and functions into an object and encourages reuse of these objects within the same and other programs."_

if we are truly of same kindred and simply put "slow of learning" then while reading that üëÜ you must have asked yourself one if not all of these questions, is "this is so hard, is programming really worth it ?, why does everything have to sound so sophisticated, did i leave the toilet sit up ?, would there ever be a season 22 of family guy ?" and so many questions we would never have the answers to üòî

Writing has always been my passion and it gives me pleasure to help and inspire people... i think, i'm not sure. i was looking for a nice closing paragraph and i assumed this would be epic but then it does sound pretty cliche now reading through it again so i'll end with something original so here goes...

> _"Peanut butter is a very terrible substitute for after shave,it burns like hell and does not prevent bumps and pimples around the shaved area. don't ask me how i know this, just trust me on this one"_
