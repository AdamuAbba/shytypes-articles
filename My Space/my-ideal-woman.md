# My Woman

A breakdown of the values i'm looking for in a woman.
## Core values

### Physical

- Must have big or up coming nyash (after all, i am but a man right? ðŸ˜‡)
### Non-tangible

- Loves wealth and is very interested in business and in making her own money. (i need re-assurance that our children are well taken care of even if i die first)
- *Strong family values*: Must love children and must be willing to have them 
- *intelligent*: she must be intelligent and can have deep stimulating conversations.
- *Humble/Growth oriented*: She must be willing to correct me and also receive corrections from me.
- Must be sweet and very kind because we will build a environment sustained by love together.
- *Must love to take care of others*: I'd rather be with a woman that would feed the hungry than boor them with prayers and religious/motivational talk of hope.
